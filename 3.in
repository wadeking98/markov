Have you ever tried to loom knit socks and been disappointed because they just didn’t fit right? It’s frustrating to put so much time into those little stitches and then end up with socks that you hate to wear. Let me show you how to customize a pattern so you can finally make loom knit socks that fit!

Typically, by the time you tackle socks on your loom you’ve had a good bit of experience with hats and scarves and want to try something new. Hats are easy to fit since they’re made to be super stretchy and you can just change your loom size to go up or down a size. And the worst that can happen with a scarf is it’s too short. Socks? Well, they’re a different story.

You guys have been asking me to make a loom knit sock tutorial for a while and I know I’ve put it off. But, honestly, I have a good reason. I knew that just making a tutorial on how to work up a sock would not be enough. It doesn’t matter if you know how to work perfect short rows (which I do show you in the video below, by the way) and can stitch a perfect toe closure if the sock doesn’t fit when you’re done. I knew that I needed to include a segment on how to custom fit a sock pattern.

Feet come in all shapes and sizes so even when you follow a pattern exactly sometimes they just don’t fit right in the toe or heel. We also have to take into account that even if you use the same loom and yarn listed in the pattern your personal gauge might be tighter or looser.

I want you to loom knit socks that fit so well that you hate to take them off. Even to wash them. I want you to have socks that feel like your feet are being gently hugged all day long with just enough room so you can wiggle your toes.

Follow my tips below and you’ll be able to stare down at your feet with that silly grin that only sock knitters exhibit. The grin that says, “Yes! I made these and they are perfect.”

Today I’m using the Horizontal Rib Tippy Toes pattern out of the Sock Loom Basics book from Leisure Arts. (This is a great pattern book with several varieties of socks including yoga socks.) I took this pattern and customized it to fit my daughter. I even let her choose the yarn because socks should be fun.

My daughter chose Lion Brand Ice Cream yarn in the delicious Tutti Fruitti color. I love the colors, but right out of the gate we run into a problem. The pattern calls for a #1 fingering weight yarn and this one is a #2 weight. I know that I can’t match the gauge in the pattern if my yarn is thicker.
~
I check the pattern again to find that they used the KB Sock Loom. This is the original sock loom with the metal pegs. It’s a fine gauge (FG) loom and I know I could use a #2 weight yarn, but it will make a pretty dense fabric. I decided to use the KB Sock Loom 2 because I want to make sure the sock has enough stretch. This small gauge (SG) loom also has the nylon pegs that I find more comfortable to use.
~
I probably should have mentioned this first. Every pattern lists the gauge in terms of how many stitches and rows the designer got when loom knitting this sock. Even if you use the same loom and yarn listed in the pattern your personal gauge could be different if you tend to knit a little tighter or looser.
~
Even if you are very careful you might be able to adjust your tension to loom a 2″ square that matches the gauge exactly. But you will never be able to do a full sock like that. In a design class I took recently the instructor said, “You knit how you knit.” It makes more sense to adjust the pattern to how you knit than to try to “correct” your tension while you’re loom knitting a full pattern.
~
The Horizontal Rib Tippy Toes patterns lists 7 stitches per inch as the stitch gauge. I know, from experience, that I absolutely can’t knit that using a small gauge loom and #2 weight yarn. Not possible!
