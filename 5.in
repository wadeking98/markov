It‚Äôs not about Meatloaf.
It‚Äôs not about me.
It‚Äôs not about what some people call me.
It‚Äôs not about left or right.

It‚Äôs all about scientific facts.
And that we‚Äôre not aware of the situation.
Unless we start to focus everything on this, our targets will soon be out of reach.

Mr. Trump likes to play the hero, and in order to be the guy who *saves* the day, he first has to take us to the brink of war.

Congress & the President should not be wasting their time and energy on a continuation of the totally partisan Impeachment Hoax when we have so many important matters pending. 196 to ZERO was the Republican House vote, & we got 3 Dems. This was not what the Founders had in mind!

President 
@realDonaldTrump
 has been resolute. We will defend America. Iranian proxy forces in Iraq thought they could act with impunity. We‚Äôve made clear to the Iranian regime that wouldn‚Äôt be the case. The American people should know we will always defend them.

The first thing Congress should do when we get back to Washington next week is pass Sen. Sanders and my bill to block funding for a war in Iran. 

It‚Äôs time for us to act on the powers the founders gave us.

Good deeds should be done with intention and not for attention. We are all blessed to be able to bless others even if it is in the slightest way. But we do not need to be boastful about that. Be boastful in regards to teaching others how they may be able to help as well.

: We‚Äôve told the Iranian regime enough. You can‚Äôt get away with using proxy forces and think your homeland will be safe and secure. We‚Äôre going to respond against the actual decision makers, the people who are causing this threat from the Islamic Republic of Iran.
